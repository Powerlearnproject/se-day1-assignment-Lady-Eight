Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 

Software engineering is a detailed study of engineering to the design, development and maintenance of software. It was introduced to address the issues of low-quality software projects. Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1948: Grace Hopper develops the first compiler, which translates human-readable code into machine code.
1957: FORTRAN, the first high-level programming language, is released.
1968: The first NATO Software Engineering Conference is held.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Requirement Gathering and Analysis
During this phase, all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop a product as per their expectation. Any ambiguities must be resolved in this phase only.

Design
In this phase, the requirement gathered in the SRS document is used as an input and software architecture that is used for implementing system development is derived.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is linear and structured, ideal for stable projects (e.g., construction). Agile is iterative and flexible, suitable for evolving projects (e.g., software development).

Implementation or Coding
Implementation/Coding starts once the developer gets the Design document. The Software design is translated into source code. All the components of the software are implemented in this phase.

Testing
Testing starts once the coding is complete and the modules are released for testing. In this phase, the developed software is tested thoroughly and any defects found are assigned to developers to get them fixed.

Deployment
Once the product is tested, it is deployed in the production environment or first UAT (User Acceptance testing) is done depending on the customer expectation.

Maintenance
After the deployment of a product on the production environment, maintenance of the product i.e. if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed or any enhancement is to be done is taken care by the developers.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Project Manager
This term means just that – someone who manages a project. Typical duties of a software project manager include:
Creating a plan for a project
Setting deadlines and ensuring they are met
Recruiting

Software Developer
A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications. Their main role is to transform requirements into functional software solutions.

QA Manager
A quality assurance (QA) manager is responsible for converting project requirements into working and functional testing scripts for ensuring that the product requirements are successfully met. These tests are known as a test plan.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) help with coding by providing features like debugging, code completion, and project management Examples: (Visual Studio Code) while Version Control Systems (VCS) track changes, enable collaboration, and prevent code loss. Examples: (Git)

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

System Testing – Evaluates the entire system’s functionality.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms the system meets user needs.
Unit Testing – Verifies individual components work correctly.
Integration Testing – Ensures multiple modules interact properly.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is identified as the key to unlocking the full potential of generative AI technologies by optimizing human-AI communication.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about smart agriculture."
Improved Prompt: "Explain how smart agriculture affects agriculture in Africa with recent examples."
The improved prompt is specific and focused, leading to a more relevant response.
